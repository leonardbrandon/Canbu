# Canbu


## About

Canbu is a cannabis consumption tracking program. It was created to help people struggling with Cannabis addictions to monitor & understand their cannabis usage, and act as a motivational aid in their recovery journey.

## Why it works

Canbu’s algorithm uses behavioural economics to map a user's consumption patterns and create a real time value chart or ‘life chart’. Research shows that we tend to give higher priority to things that are happening in the near present vs things that will happen in the future. Addictions often provide an immediate escape from a number of root causes compounding the negative effects of future consequences. Canbu’s life chart provides immediate feedback and a more accurate snapshot of wellbeing helping to counteract the impact of short term prioritisation. 

There are two ways that this can help. First is the immediate gratification of either seeing positive results that come from abstinence or the negative results or loss leader effect that comes from losing value in the case of consumption. 

The second is in seeing an accurate picture of well being. Feelings about ‘how it's going’ can vary widely from actual results based on a user's mood and perspective. This can lead to relapse or compound relapse if they occur.  Seeing a snapshot of your life chart can give users a more accurate picture of well-being providing hope in some cases or warning in others depending on the situation.  

## How we calculate

Absence of cannabis use causes a users life chart value to go up and cannabis usage causes the value to go down. We track THC amounts at the time of purchase, and in combination with a user's custom tolerance levels the algorithm will convert their empirical data and plot their well being on a graph. 

Based on an individual's user data, we are able to create a baseline. This is a line which represents a user's highest allowable usage amount before ‘their life starts falling apart’. Consumption levels that cause users' value to go below this line means things are not going well and additional help in their recovery journey is required. Users who maintain abstinence or are actively decreasing consumption will move away from their baseline. 

The goal for all users is to decrease their cannabis consumption and as they see increases in their well being this will be reflected in their life chart. We are working on additional features / rewards / incentives / milestones to help with this goal.
